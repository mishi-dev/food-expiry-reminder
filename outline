#outline - This code is only a rough sketch, and would require additional work to be fully functional:

# Import necessary libraries
import cv2  # for image processing
import pytesseract  # for OCR
import tensorflow as tf  # for machine learning

# Define a function for capturing or uploading an image
def capture_or_upload_image():
    # Capture or upload the image using OpenCV
    pass

# Define a function for converting the image to text
def image_to_text(image):
    # Use Tesseract to extract text from the image
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    return text

# Define a function for identifying the food in the image
def identify_food(text):
    # Load a pre-trained machine learning model for food recognition
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model("food_recognition_model.h5")
    
    # Use the model to predict the food type
    food_type = model.predict(text)
    return food_type

# Define a function for creating a summary containing the food type and best before or expiration date
def create_summary(text, food_type):
    # Use natural language processing techniques to extract the best before or expiration date from the text
    best_before_date = extract_best_before_date(text)
    
    # Create the summary using the food type and best before date
    summary = "Food type: " + food_type + "\nBest before date: " + best_before_date
    return summary

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Capture or upload the image
    image = capture_or_upload_image()
    
    # Convert the image to text
    text = image_to_text(image)
    
    # Identify the food in the image
    food_type = identify_food(text)
    
    # Create the summary
    summary = create_summary(text, food_type)
    
    # Print the summary
    print(summary)
